🏓 Pong Game  
A classic Pong game built using Python’s Turtle module. Control paddles to bounce the ball back and forth — miss the ball and your opponent scores!

**🎮 How It Works**  
- Two players control their paddles using keyboard keys.  
- The ball moves automatically across the screen.  
- It bounces off the top and bottom walls.  
- If it touches a paddle, it bounces back.  
- If it goes past a paddle, the other player scores a point.  
- The scoreboard keeps track of the score in real-time.

**🧠 Concepts Used**  
- Python classes and object-oriented programming  
- Turtle graphics for rendering paddles, ball, and scoreboard  
- Keyboard event handling for paddle movement  
- Game loop with screen updates and collision detection  
- Score tracking and game state reset logic

**🧰 Requirements**  
- Python 3.x installed  
- No external libraries needed — uses only Python’s built-in `turtle` module
